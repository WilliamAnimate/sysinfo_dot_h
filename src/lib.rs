//! This crate uses raw FFI bindings to easily and quickly get and use the <sys/sysinfo.h> struct.
//! Please read the [README](https://github.com/WilliamAnimate/sysinfo_dot_h?tab=readme-ov-file#sysinfo-dot-h) if you want to know more.

//! Internally, this crate calls `unsafe {}` because of FFI. You, the programmer, are ultimately
